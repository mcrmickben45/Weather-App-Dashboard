## Introduction

The development of a weather dashboard serves as a valuable tool for travelers, offering a user-friendly interface to assess current and future weather conditions in multiple cities at the tip of their fingers! This project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS/BootStrap for visual refinement, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Users can easily input a city of interest through a form, triggering the display of city-specific details, including city name, date, weather indicative icons, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The dashboard automatically adds searched cities to the history for quick access. The inclusion of a 5-day forecast enhances trip planning and the interface extends to the search history, allowing users to easily revisit previous weather inquiries. In summary, this weather dashboard optimizes travel planning through seamless navigation and dynamic data presentation, making it a valuable resource for travelers seeking comprehensive and up-to-date weather information.
